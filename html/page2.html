		<div class="heading">HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</div>
		<p class="paragraph">Hydropower is an affordable source of electricity that costs less than most. Since hydropower relies only on the energy from moving water, states that get the majority of their electricity from hydropower, like Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, have lower energy bills than the rest of the country.

			Compared to other electricity sources, hydropower also has relatively low costs throughout the duration of a full project lifetime in terms of maintenance, operations, and fuel. Like any major energy source, significant upfront costs are unavoidable, but hydropowerâ€™s longer lifespan spreads these costs out over time. Additionally, the equipment used at hydropower facilities often operates for longer periods of time without needing replacements or repairs, saving money in the long term.</p>

		<br><br><div class="heading">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HYDROPOWER?</div>
		<p class=" paragraph flex-row"> <ul class="paragraph">
			<li>Hydropower is fueled by water, making it a clean source of energy.</li> <br>
			<li>Hydroelectric power is a domestic source of energy, allowing each state to produce its own energy without being reliant on international fuel sources.</li> <br>
			<li>Impoundment hydropower creates reservoirs that offer recreational opportunities such as fishing, swimming, and boating. Most hydropower installations are required to provide some public access to the reservoir to allow the public to take advantage of these opportunities.</li> <br>
			<li>Hydroelectric power is flexible. Some hydropower facilities can quickly go from zero power to maximum output. Because hydropower plants can generate power to the grid immediately, they provide essential backup power during major electricity outages or disruptions.</li> <br>
			<img src="/img/dam.png"  style=" width:40vw" class="margin" alt="">
			<li>Hydropower provides benefits beyond electricity generation by providing flood control, irrigation support, and clean drinking water.</li> <br>
			<li>Hydropower is affordable. Hydropower provides low-cost electricity and durability over time compared to other sources of energy. Construction costs can even be mitigated by using preexisting structures such as bridges, tunnels, and dams.</li> <br>
			<li>Hydropower complements other renewable energy sources. Technologies like pumped storage hydropower (PSH) store energy to use in tandem with renewables such as wind and solar power when demand is high.</li> <br>
			<li>Hydropower creates jobs in rural locations and boosts local economies.</li> <br></ul></p>
