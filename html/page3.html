		<div class="heading">HYDROPOWER IN INDIA</div>
		<p class="paragraph">In 1947, hydropower capacity in India was about 37 percent of the total power generating capacity and over 53 percent of power generation. In the late 1960s, growth in coal-based power generation initiated the decline in hydropower’s share in both capacity and generation. In 2022, hydropower capacity of 46,512 MW (megawatts) accounted for roughly 11.7 percent of total capacity. Roughly 12 percent of power generation in 2020-21 was from hydropower. <br> <br>

			In the first two decades since independence (1947-67), hydropower capacity addition grew by over 13 percent and power generation from hydro stations grew by 11.8 percent. In the following two decades (1967-1987) hydropower generation capacity grew by over 18 percent but hydro power generation grew only by 5.6 percent. The decline continued in the following decade (1987-2007) with both capacity addition and hydro-power generation growth falling to just over 3 percent. In 2007-2019, hydropower capacity addition grew by just over 1 percent and power generation from hydro-stations grew by under 1 percent. Specific generation or power generated per unit of capacity (a measure of economic efficiency) declined from over 4.4 in the 1960s to less than 2.5 in the early 2000s. Specific generation has improved since then reaching 3.4 in 2019-20.</p>

		<br><br><div class="heading">HISTORY OF HYDROPOWER</div>
		<p class=" paragraph flex-row"> Hydropower is one of the oldest sources of energy for producing mechanical and electrical energy and up until 2019, it was the largest source of total annual U.S. renewable electricity generation. Thousands of years ago, people used hydropower to turn paddle wheels on rivers to grind grain. Before steam power and electricity were available in the United States, grain and lumber mills were powered directly with hydropower.

				<p class="paragraph">
					Some of the key developments in hydropower technology happened in the first half of the ninteenth century. In 1827, French engineer Benoit Fourneyron developed a turbine capable of producing around 6 horsepower – the earliest version of the Fourneyron reaction turbine.
					In 1849, British–American engineer James Francis developed the first modern water turbine – the Francis turbine – which remains the most widely-used water turbine in the world today. In the 1870s, American inventor Lester Allan Pelton developed the Pelton wheel, an impulse water turbine, which he patented in 1880.
					Into the 20th century, Austrian professor Viktor Kaplan developed the Kaplan turbine in 1913 – a propeller-type turbine with adjustable blades.
