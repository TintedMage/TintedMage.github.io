		<p class=" paragraph">Modern hydropower plants are helping to accelerate the clean energy transition, providing essential power, storage, flexibility and climate mitigation services. <br><br>Hydropower is also a key asset for building secure, clean systems and reaching global electricity targets.</p>

		<div class=" heading">Types of hydropower</div>
		<p class=" paragraph">
			There are four main types of hydropower plants: run-of-river, storage, pumped storage and offshore hydropower. <br>
			Only a small minority of the world's dams are built for hydropower, with the majority used for irrigation, water supply, flood control and other purposes.

				<p class=" paragraph">Many hydropower dams are used for multiple purposes beyond electricity generation, providing infrastructure to supply clean water for homes, industry and agriculture, as well as recreation and transportation services.

				Hydropower projects can be used to regulate and store water to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events such as floods and drought, which are on the rise due to climate change.</p>

			<div class=" heading">Low-carbon and pollution-free</div>
			<p class=" paragraph">Hydropower is among the cleanest sources of electricity, with a low greenhouse gas emission intensity compared to other energy forms.

				Independent research suggests that use of hydropower instead of fossil fuels for electricity generation has helped to avoid more than 100 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in the past 50 years alone, exceeding even the emissions averted by nuclear power. That’s roughly equivalent to the total annual carbon footprint of the United States for 20 years.

				Over the life cycle of a power plant, hydropower offers some of the lowest greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated – as well as multiple environmental benefits. (IEA Hydropower Special Market Report 2021)



				If hydropower was replaced by coal, IHA estimates up to 4 billion tonnes of additional greenhouse gases would be emitted annually, increasing global emissions from fossil fuels and industry by 10 per cent. There would also be 150 million more tonnes of air polluting particulates emitted each year.
